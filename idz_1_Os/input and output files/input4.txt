My Valentine

What if it rained?
We didn't care
She said that someday soon
The sun was
Andshewas
rightThisloveofmine,


As days and nights
Would pass me by
I tell myself that I waswaitingfor a sign
Then
she appeared A lovesofine,


And I will love her for life
And I will never let a day go
byWithout remembering reasons why
She makes mecertain
That Ican fly

And so I do
Without care
I know that someday soon
The sun gonna shine
And she'll be there
This loveofmine,
MyValentine
